Introduction
------------

Welcome to the Phone Bill Application! This is a command-line
application that allows the user to model a phone bill. In its
current version, the user may associate at most one phone record
per customer name. However, the information will not be stored
between each usage. A single phone record consists of the phone
number of the caller, the phone number that was called, the time
at which the call began, and the time at which the call ended.
